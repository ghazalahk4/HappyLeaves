This interactive tool helps employees reflect on their thought patterns about taking vacation or personal leave.
It begins with common behavioral reasons and then invites open reflection to identify cognitive biases and recommend tailored nudges.

## How It Works and Ties into Behavioral Dynamics

This tool is designed based on the behavioral dynamics framework (Motivation -> Cognition -> Emotion -> Behavior), and integrates environmental factors like mandates, persuasion, and nudges.

- **Motivation**: The employee may be motivated to rest but hesitates due to implicit pressure.
- **Cognition**: Through text input and guided options, the user reveals hidden biases (e.g., fear of judgment, indispensability, billing issues).
- **Emotion**: These thoughts are often emotionally charged (guilt, anxiety, fear of being left out).
- **Behavior**: The resulting behavior is inaction‚Äîi.e., not taking leave despite being eligible.
- **Nudge Architecture**: The app provides a supportive intervention (nudge) that is psychologically matched to the specific cognitive bias, helping reframe the situation.

This framework is supported by research studies showing that self-efficacy, anticipated workload stress, and workplace culture strongly influence employees' decision to take or skip time off (Hahn et al., 2011; Smit & Barber, 2016; Ferguson et al., 2015).

Additional support from real-world organizational reports indicates that resistance to transparency, fear of being perceived as non-performant, and cultural norms perpetuate burnout cycles if not corrected through digital behavioral nudging (MDE Individual Assignment Report, 2024).
